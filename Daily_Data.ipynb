    "# IEL DATA EXPLORATION\n",
    "This Jupiter notebook is used to explore the data and record my thought process of how I will approach the problem. Early on in the project I changed data sources from initially using multiple sources (NRFA, River Levels UK, SEPA) however, I changed this so all data is coming from SEPA's API as this contains a larger volume of data and is more accurate. However, because of this change some observations which I made in the previous dataset are saved in the OLD DATA notebook. I have copied the relevant sections from the old notebook to this one so that I can refer back to them if needed."

The reason for choosing this station is because it has approximately the same latitude, and geography as the fictitious island of Claddach and monitors a river pretty much all the way from the source to the river estuary.

As well as the fact that on a daily, or even hourly basis, this will depend upon the weather conditions as more sunshine and warmer weather will lead to more evaporation and less ending up in the river. Therefore for now, we will set the percentage of rainfall which ends up in the river to a figure which results in the cumulative water difference throughout the year being equal to 0.
