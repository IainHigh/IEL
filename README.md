## Data
This directtory contains 4 subdirectories:
* 'Daily_Averages' and 'Quater_Hourly_Readings' contain the data downloaded from SEPA's website. More information about these files can be found in the README.md file in the Data directory.
* 'Generated Data' contains the data generated by the DataGenerator.py script for the quarter hourly readings and the daily aggregates. This is the main output directory for the DataGenerator.py script.
* 'Simplified Generated Data' contains a simplified version of the data in the 'Generated Data' directory. Since the data is intended for primary school students, the numerical values are converted into words (high, low, etc.) so it can be easily understood by the students. More information about this is described in the 'simplifyData' function in the DataGenerator.py script.
